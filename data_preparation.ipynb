Dabei haben manche Spieler mehrere Ratings pro Jahr, andere nur ein Rating pro Jahr, wieder andere nur ein Rating in mehreren Jahren. Um diese unterschiedlichen Vorraussetzungen für alle Spieler auf ein Niveau zu bringen, werden mehrere unterjährige Ratings auf ein einzelnes gemittelt. Im folgenden wird dann für jeden Spieler das Rating aus dem benötigten Jahr verwendet. Gibt es kein Rating aus diesem Jahr, wird das naheliegenste Rating herangezogen."
